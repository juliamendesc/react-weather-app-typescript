## Reflection

This was a 3-hour project intended to refresh knowledge on consuming external APIs and passing information to React Components.

This was a 3 week long project built during my third module at Turing School of Software and Design. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

The idea came from a tutorial to develop this app in Javascript on [FreeCodeCamp Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Reny0cTTv24). I also saved all keys in an .env file and updated relative to absolute path for consistency and increased security.

Further, I decided to shift this project from Javascript to Typescript and found it very challenging to type methods and variables from the libraries it used such as [react-select](https://react-select.com/typescript#typescript-usage), [react-select-async-paginate](https://github.com/vtaits/react-select-async-paginate), and [react-accessible-accordion](https://react-accessible-accordion.springload.co.nz/). Although I tried my best to type answers, some variables had to be changed back to <i>any</i> or <i>unknown</i> because of the intrinsic types.
